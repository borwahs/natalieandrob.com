# Usage

Install dependencies first for npm:

    $ npm install

To start the development server (both the client and the API servers):

    $ npm run development-server
    
This will "live reload" both the client and the server code so you don't ever have to stop and start anything.

To start the production server:

    $ npm run production-server
    
This will build the client side code and start the API server with forever.
